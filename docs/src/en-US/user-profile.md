# User Profile

The [Profile section](readeck-instance://profile) of Readeck lets you change your personal information, you password and some other settings.

## Edit your profile

On the main profile page, you can change your username, your email address and choose the app's language.

## Change your password

On the [Password](readeck-instance://profile/password) page, you can change the password you use to connect to Readeck.

## API Tokens

An API Token lets you access and use the [Readeck API](readeck-instance://docs/api) for anything you'd like to build. You can create and manage tokens on the [API Tokens](readeck-instance://profile/tokens) section of your user profile.

You can limit what a given token can access through the API and for how long it's valid.

If you need to grant access to your Readeck account to a service or an app, you can't provide you main username and password; it won't work.

Instead, you can give your username and a token of your choice as authentication credentials.
