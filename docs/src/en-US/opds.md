# E-book Catalog

Readeck provides an E-book Catalog of all your bookmarks, organized in a catalog with the structure below:

- Unread Bookmarks
- Archived Bookmarks
- Favorite Bookmarks
- All Bookmarks
- Bookmark Collections
  - (Collection Name)
    - Collection E-book
    - Browse Collection

Each section, except Collections, provides every bookmark as an E-book.

On a collection's section, you can download the full collection as a single E-book.


## Catalog access

The catalog can be accessed by any app or e-reader supporting the OPDS format.
To give access to the catalog, you must first create an [API Token](readeck-instance://profile/tokens).

You can restrict the permission of this token to "Bookmarks : Read Only".
Write the token value down and setup your app.

The URL of your OPDS catalog is: \
[readeck-instance://opds](readeck-instance://opds)


## Example setup: Koreader

[Koreader](https://koreader.rocks/) is a document viewer for E Ink devices. It's available for Kindle, Kobo, PocketBook, Android and desktop Linux. It has a very good OPDS support.

Once you have an API Token, you can access the OPDS section in Koreader's lookup menu:

This section shows a list of preconfigured OPDS sources and you can add yours by pressing the "+" icon on the top left corner:

In this dialog replace the fields below with:

- https://readeck.example.com : `readeck-instance://opds`
- alice: your username
- your API Token in the last field
